An under construction collection of UI activity indicators(AKA *spinners*).

Where applicable the spinners are parametrized with CSS variables.
The bundled Node.js build script preprocesses them with some PostCSS plugins, such as:

* postcss-import 
* postcss-custom-properties
* postcss-calc
* autoprefixer-core
